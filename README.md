# Autonomous Ackermann Vehicle Project

## About
This project aims to design and build a **low-cost autonomous vehicle** with an **Ackermann steering mechanism**. The main goal of the vehicle is to autonomously **park between two static obstacles** (representing cars) using board-off processing. The project includes complete modeling, hardware design, software control, and testing.

## Features
- Low-cost autonomous vehicle with Ackermann steering.
- Board-off processing for real-time control.
- Path planning and obstacle avoidance.
- Parking demonstration between two obstacles.
- Modular hardware and software design.
