## Description
This project focuses on designing and implementing a small autonomous vehicle with an **Ackermann steering mechanism** capable of **automatic parallel parking**. The main goal is to demonstrate practical vehicle control in confined spaces and implement a simple navigation system using **accessible and low-cost hardware**. 

The vehicle uses an **Arduino Mega** as the central processing unit, along with a set of **sensors** to gather environmental information and **motors** to control steering and movement.
